1. docker-compose -f ./docker/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
2. along with docker, prometheus and grafana are deployed, by docker-compose ps status you can display the statuses of services and see their ports, then go to see metrics
3. To start helm we use helm upgrade --install go-app ./helm -f ./helm/values.yaml 
4. we can preconfigure prometheus with prometheus
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus 
in this way we get a ready prometheus + graphane in the cluster, which monitors all pods, then it is enough to go in, make an import in graphane this template, and everything will be ready 18283.
